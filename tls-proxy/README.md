# TLS proxy

TLS proxy server for NMDC protocol, written in Go, currently supported by Verlihub version `1.2.0.5` and later.

As of Verlihub version `1.6.0.0` it is included in source code with ability to compile as built-in library using following option:

`cmake -DUSE_TLS_PROXY=ON ..`

## Install Go

Debian based distributions:

`sudo apt install golang-go`

Minimum required Go version is `1.13` - first version to support TLS `1.3` without hacks.

## Important to know

Remember to set twice the regular `ulimit` before starting both servers, because there will be twice as many connections than you would usually have.

Verlihub does that automatically when using `vh` command line utility.

## Common setup

By default, to use TLS proxy you only need to change `tls_listen_port` from `0` to any local port, `tls_listen_ip` is already set to `127.0.0.1`, and restart your hub.

To stop using TLS proxy, simply set back `tls_listen_port` to `0` and restart the hub.

`listen_ip`, `listen_port` and `extra_listen_ports` will be applied automatically either to externally listening hub without TLS proxy, or to proxy itself with locally listening hub.

## Moving from command line

If you were previously using command line version of TLS proxy, all you need to do is to change `listen_ip` from `127.0.0.1` to your external IP address, shut down command line server and restart your hub.

## Required TLS version

By default TLS proxy requires TLS version `1.2` and higher, to change that use `tls_min_ver` variable, parameter is minor version number: `0` - `1.0`, `1` - `1.1`, `2` - `1.2`, `3` - `1.3`

## Generating certificates

You can either generate or buy your own certificates, or let TLS proxy to generate self-signed certificates that are valid in `5` years.

## Configuration variables

`listen_ip` - Listening address either for hub or proxy, default: `0.0.0.0`

`listen_port` - Main listening port either for hub or proxy, default: `4111`

`extra_listen_ports` - Extra listening ports either for hub or proxy, separated by space, default: `<none>`

`tls_listen_ip` - Local listening address for hub when proxy is enabled, default: `127.0.0.1`

`tls_listen_port` - Local listening port for hub, `0` means proxy is disabled, default: `0`

`tls_only_mode` - Allow only TLS-encrypted users to enter hub, default: `No`

`not_tls_redirect` - Redirect address for users who are not TLS-encrypted, default: `<none>`

`tls_detect_wait` - Protocol detection time in milliseconds, default: `600`

`tls_cert_file` - Name of public certificate file in hub configuration directory, default: `hub.crt`

`tls_key_file` - Name of private key file in hub configuration directory, default: `hub.key`

`tls_cert_org` - Organisation name for self-signed certificate, default: `Verlihub`

`tls_cert_host` - Hostname for self-signed certificate, default: `localhost`

`tls_min_ver` - Minimum required TLS version, default: `2` - equals to `1.2`

`tls_buf_size` - Proxy socket read buffer size in KB, default: `10`

`tls_err_log` - Enable TLS proxy error logging to standard output, default: `No`

## Old style command

In case you don't use our TLS proxy with Verlihub, or want to keep using old style stand alone command line version, you can compile the `cmd/proxy.go`:

```
git clone https://github.com/verlihub/tls-proxy.git
cd tls-proxy
go build ./cmd/proxy.go
```

These are the command line start options:

`host` - Space separated list of hosts to listen on

`wait` - Time to wait to detect the protocol

`hub` - Hub address to connect to

`net` - Network type: `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `tcp`, `unix`

`ip` - Send client IP: `1`/`0`

`log` - Enable error logging: `1`/`0`

`cert` - Public .crt file: `hub.crt`

`key` - Private .key file: `hub.key`

`cert-org` - Certificate organisation

`cert-mail` - Certificate email

`cert-host` - Certificate hostname

`ver` - Minimum required TLS version: `0` - `1.0`, `1` - `1.1`, `2` - `1.2`, `3` - `1.3`

`buf` - Buffer size in KB

## Protocol specification

Following command is sent to the hub right after the connection is established:

`$MyIP 2.3.4.5 1.0|`

`2.3.4.5` is the real IP address of connected user.
Second parameter stands for TLS version used by client, in case of non secure connection, `0.0` is passed to hub.
